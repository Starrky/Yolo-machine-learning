Script to clean JSON export from Label Studio. Remove mismatches:
if the image doesn't have a label or if the label doesn't have an image

Need to provide the following variables:
- EXPORT_FILE: path to the JSON export file from Label Studio
- OUTPUT_FILE: path to the cleaned JSON export file you want to use later
- IMAGES_DIR: path to the directory where the images are stored that were used for the label studio locally
